# AzureVulnerabilityManagement
This project is demonstration using OpenVAS to create a Vulnerability Management Lab on Azure. I will be creating a OpenVAS configured VM and a client VM. To simulate vulnerability scanning I will make the Client intentionally vulnerable then try to fix those vulnerabilities as they are detected on OpenVAS VM.
