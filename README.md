# Azure Vulnerability Management using OpenVAS

## Description

This project is a demonstration for using OpenVAS by creating a Vulnerability Management Lab on Azure. I will be creating a OpenVAS configured VM and a client VM. To simulate vulnerability detection of OpenVAS tool, I will scan Client after it creation on default settings than intentionally make it vulnerable by installing multiple outdated application which are very common then do another scan and try to fix the vulnerabilities shown on OpenVAS by updating system and removing outdated applications. I will do another final scan to show you how many vulnerabilities gets fixed.
